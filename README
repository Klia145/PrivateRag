# Intelligent Document Q&A System (RAG)

The Intelligent Document Q&A System integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, enabling users to query documents locally stored on their computers. It automatically processes, indexes, and retrieves relevant information, providing precise and context-based answers.

## Release Notes (v2.0)

- Automatic document processing and indexing
- Improved semantic retrieval with FAISS
- Enhanced graphical user interface (Tkinter-based)

## Features

- **Automatic Document Processing**: Upload `.txt` documents which are automatically split into semantic chunks and indexed.
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Quickly retrieve relevant document chunks using semantic search.
- **Contextual Answers**: Generate accurate, context-aware responses via local Ollama API.
- **Intuitive GUI**: Easily interact with the system using a user-friendly interface.

## Components

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Document Processing (`buildTheKnowledge.py`)**
   - Handles automatic document chunking and indexing.
   - Utilizes SentenceTransformers for text embeddings.
   - Indexes document embeddings using FAISS.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation Module (`BuildTheRAG.py`)**
   - Performs semantic search to retrieve relevant context.
   - Generates natural language responses via local Ollama models.

3. **Graphical User Interface (`main.py`)**
   - Developed with Tkinter for ease of use.
   - Provides functionalities for document uploading and interactive question-answering.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- FAISS
- SentenceTransformers
- Ollama (locally running)

Install required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install faiss-cpu sentence-transformers requests unstructured tkinter
```

Ensure Ollama server is running locally:

```bash
ollama serve
```

## Usage

### Uploading Documents

1. Launch the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Click **"Select and Upload TXT Document"** in the GUI.
3. Choose your `.txt` document. The system will automatically process and index it.

### Asking Questions

1. Enter your question in the provided text box.
2. Click the **"Submit Question"** button.
3. View the generated answer based on the indexed document contents.

## Troubleshooting

- **File Upload Issues**: Verify that your files are in `.txt` format and retry.
- **Generation Errors**: Ensure the Ollama server is active and accessible.
- **Indexing Problems**: Check console outputs for error messages during indexing.

## Technical Details

### Communication Protocol

- Semantic retrieval powered by FAISS.
- Language generation handled locally through Ollama API calls.

### Security Considerations

- Keep your document contents secure and regularly back up data.
- Be cautious when processing sensitive information.
